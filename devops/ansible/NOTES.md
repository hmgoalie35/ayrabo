## TODO
#### Deployment:
    * Run dist upgrade.

### NOTES
* A few preconditions must be met before running the playbooks
    * python 2 is installed.
    * A user named `ess` must exist.
    * ssh keys must be set up for `ess`
* Don't need `become_user: root` because the default is `root`
* Use `{{ ansible_managed }}` in templates to tell user don't touch the file, it's auto generated by ansible.
    * https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_configuration.html#ansible-managed.
* Configure this when needed https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_configuration.html#vault-password-file.
