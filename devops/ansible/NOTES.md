## TODO
#### Deployment:
* ~~Run dist upgrade.~~
* ~~Create new directory for each deployment and venv in directory~~
* ~~Make pip cache packages, specify cache to live in directory or project files. We want fast venv builds~~
* ~~Have generic folder where all directories for each deployment live~~
* ~~Gunicorn point to symlink which points to desired deployment. Deploy directory being tags won't work for qa staging environments~~
* bit.ly/db-mg
* Setup accounts with as limited privileges as possible
* Git archive if not using push to deploy
* Build wheel of project?
* media files need to be stored outside of project dir (new project dir created each deployment)
* ~~`.env` file.~~
* Backup db before deployments
* gunicorn forwarded allow ips, make sure django knows https
* lets encrypt
* supervisor for postgres, nginx
* email, ssl
* see TODOs in settings.py
* media folder needs to be stored outside project dir for prod, for testing it can be stored in project dir.
* clean up `dist/`. Only files needed should be in there...
* fix up error pages
* Need to have proxy strip X-Forwarded-Proto header and then set it myself so nobody can spoof the header

### Usage
* A few preconditions must be met on the remote hosts before running the playbooks
    * python 2 is installed.
    * A user named `ess` must exist.
    * ssh keys must be set up for `ess`

### NOTES
* Don't need `become_user: root` because the default is `root`
* Use `{{ ansible_managed }}` in templates to tell user don't touch the file, it's auto generated by ansible.
    * https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_configuration.html#ansible-managed.
* https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_variables.html#magic-variables-and-how-to-access-information-about-other-hosts
* secret_key can't have `=` sign. in settings.py, `.split('=')` breaks

#### Nginx
* When deploying to multiple servers, take one nginx out of the load balancer, or maybe shut down that server?

* Caching: https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/content-caching/
* Actual ssl certificate, not snakeoil...
